Devops is mainly three things -

- Infrastructure
- Automation
- Monitoring

### Infrastructure

You need a server for hosting, server is an infrastructure. You need database for backend, database is infrastructure.
**It refers to the underlying system and hardware responsible for development and delivery**.

### Automation

It means automating stuff being done manually to waste less time doing the same stuff.

### Monitoring

It means keeping track of application working, finding problems and bugs and fixing them right away.

## Roadmap

- Start learning basic linux commands
- Start with networking concepts - VPC, CIDR block, Subnetting **DNS Records**(https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/#:~:text=DNS%20records%20(aka%20zone%20files,is%20known%20as%20DNS%20syntax.), route tables
- Virtualization using vbox or vmware(not needed rn)
- Programming(Python) and Git. Learn Django, flask and Boto3 for automation.
- Create Projects and push on git repos
- Do the AWS practitioner course to understand AWS services to work on them.
- Learn Infrastructure as Code with help of YAML and JSON. Learn **Terraform** - what it is, how it automates, it's resources, provisioners, providers, variables and outputs.
- Learn **Ansible** which is configuration management tool to configure multiple servers at a time.
- Learn **CI/CD**. Start with understanding **principle of automation and continous improvement**. Difference between pipelines CI(Source => Build => Test) => CD(Deploy). Get hands on with **Jenkins and Gitlab**.
- Do projects on **setting pipelines that automatically builds and tests your code everytime it's changed and how to deploy it on production safely**.
- Learn **Docker** and **Kubernetes**. What is Docker? How to create it? What is DockerFile? What is DockerImage? What is Kubernetes? How to deploy application on Kubernetes? Architecture of Kubernetes?
